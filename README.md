## Objective<a name="objective"></a>
The aim of this project is to research the tips data set. that include following tasks
1. Create a jupyter notebook that use descriptive statistics and plots to describe the tips dataset.
2. Discuss and analyse whether there is a relationship between the totalbill and tip amount
3. Analyse the relationship between the variables within the dataset.

# Background Information <a name="background"></a>
In one restaurant, a food server recorded this data on all customers they served during an interval of two and a half months in early 1990. The restaurant, located in a suburban shopping mall, was part of a national chain and served a varied menu. In observance of local law, the restaurant offered to seat in a non-smoking section to patrons who requested it. Each record includes a day and time. sex column contain the sex of person paying for the meal source:https://www.kaggle.com/ranjeetjain3/seaborn-tips-dataset

This dataset contain 244 rows and 7 columns of data, columns are the variables and rows are the number of observations.

__columns__
 - total_bill: The amount of total bill
 - tip : the amount of tip 
 - sex : gender (Male,Female)
 - smoker: value(Yes, No)
 - day : days of week(Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun)
 - time : time(Lunch, Dinner)
 - size : number of people in group (1,2,3,4,5,6) 
 
categorical data column
 - sex 
 - smoker
 - day
 - time
 
 numerical data column
 - total_bill
 - tip
 - size    

# Statistical Analysis <a name="statistics"></a>
Statistical Analysis is a process of understanding how variables in a dataset relate to each other and how those relationships depend on other variables.

# Regression <a name="regression"></a>
The process of fitting a line to a set of data is called linear regression and the line of best fit is called regression line. The regression line provides a model of a linear association between two variablles.
